Joins and Subqueries
|CATDESC|
<p>This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: joining.  Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question.  This isn't just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalisation of data, which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.

<p>This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little time on subqueries (queries within queries). If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007270.do">Learning SQL</a>, by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject.</p>
