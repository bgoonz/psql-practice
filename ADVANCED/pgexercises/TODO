SITE CODE:
try to make syntax highlighting more consistent between editor and viewer
mini-tutorial for first-time visitors- particularly to expose the help button
make import/export of progress
make the site work correctly on mobile/tablets
Make the site more googleable - use of words like 'tutorial', 'SQL', and 'learning' in the title, for example
improve documentation
substantial refactor of the scripts directory (particularly processdocs.pl).  These have grown fairly organically, and some major clarification of the code is in order
clean up site generation code - use a single code library to generate query results for static site generation and dynamic retrieval
test scripts that load each page of the web site in turn and check that the provided answer produces a tick on the web site.
make the site generation a smidge more generic to allow easy rebranding, for example.
