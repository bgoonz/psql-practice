## Useful DBA tools by Data Egret
### 83compat.sql

### check_are_all_subscribed.sql

### check_missing_grants.sql

### check_strange_fk.sql

### check_uniq_indexes.sql
List all tables which do not have UNIQUE CONSTRAINTs.

### check_config.sql
This query is used for getting non default configuration parameters in PostgreSQL.
For user/client sessions you can see modified parameters, but reset_val will contain value from configuration file (I hope).
If you see (*) before config name it means that parameter has default value.
If you see (c) after config name it means that parameter was changed for client session or by another reason (database, user, etc).
If you see !!! after config name it means that parameter were changed in file but still not apllied.
All fields in report are aligned by width for simplifying a compare procedures.

### create_db_activity_view.sql

Creates more convenient VIEW around pg_stat_activity pg_catalog view. 	
Shows all non idle queries running more then 100ms (optionally 500ms - see a comment in view DDL).
Requires track_activities=enabled in postgresql.conf to display processes states correctly. 

This view works with PostgreSQL version < 9.2, to use the view with 9.2 or higher please refer create_db_activity_view9.2.sql
 

Columns:

* ts_age - time elapsed since transaction started 

* state - process state (active, idle, idle in transaction, idle in transaction (aborted), fastpath function call or disabled when track_activities setting is switched off)
