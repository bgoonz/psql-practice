#### What is a Database?

The **database** is an organized collection of structured data that is used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data.

#### What is SQL and Relational Database?

A **relational database** is a type of database that stores access to data points that are related to one another.

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language in programming that can manipulate a relational database.

#### What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** also known as '**Postgres**' is an open-source, robust, high-performance object-relational database system that extends the SQL language with a lot of great features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

### Getting Started

#### Setup & Install PostgreSQL

Just follow this link [Linux downloads (Ubuntu)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) and copy the script then paste on your terminal to install on Ubuntu using the apt repository.

For other systems follow this official link [Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to download and for the installation instructions.

#### PostgreSQL Roles and User Login

PostgreSQL role is a feature by PostgreSQL for handling authentication and authorization. It's a concept of managing permissions where more than one roles can be created and roles can be members of other roles, allowing them to take on the permission to manipulate changes.

##### Accessing with Switching Accounts

After installation by default PostgreSQL created an account called _postgres_ that is the default PostgreSQL Role. To log in this account, switch over to the _postgres_ type this command:

`$ sudo -i -u postgres`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/01.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To access a Postgres prompt type:

`$ psql`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/02.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now you will be logged in and able to start the interaction with the database.

To quit from Postgres prompt just type this command:

`postgres=# \q`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/03.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

##### Accessing without Switching Accounts

Following is the command that will log into Postgres without the intermediary _bash_ shell in between. That means this will redirect to you on the `psql` command prompt:

`$ sudo -u postgres psql`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/04.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

##### How to check Roles in PostgreSQL

To check the list of roles first type the following command:

`psql`

then type this:

`\du`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/05.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We will see the list of roles with their name, list of attributes, and member of which role.

##### Create roles in PostgreSQL

We noticed that by default there is a role named `postgres`. We can also create a new roll

from the Postgres prompt.

First, enter into the prompt by typing `psql` if you are not already in.

Then we can create a role simply typing this:

`CREATE ROLE new_roll_name;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/06.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

And we can add a password for the login session and add attributes that will define which types of access the role has been authorized to manipulate into the database. Then we can also add to the column 'member of' if the role is under any member.

Let's add a role where the user name is `SubAdmin`with authorized as `SUPERUSER`, `CREATEDB`attributes and `PASSWORD`is 'abcd':

`CREATE ROLE SubAdmin WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB PASSWORD 'abcd'; `

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/07.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Type `\du` to see the newly created role.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/08.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

##### Update and Delete a Role in PostgreSQL

Suppose we need to add more attributes to our new role `lib10` and that means we need to update the role attributes change the password.

To update attributes to the new role and change it's password type the command:

`ALTER USER WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'Newabcd';`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/10.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

If we need to delete a role than simply type:

`DROP ROLE SubAdmin;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/12.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

##### Create and Delete Roles from using shell commands (Without connecting `psql`)

To create a database role with non-superuser access from the shell just type and enter:

`createuser -PE RoleName`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/13.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Where our `-P` flag prompts to set a password for the new role and the `-E`flag indicates to store the password as an MD5-encrypted string.

We can check the role created by connecting to `psql`and running `\du` command.

To Delete a database role from the shell just type:

`dropuser -i RoleName`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/14.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To create a superuser from the shell type:

`createuser -sPE SuperuserName`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/15.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### How to create database

There are two ways to create a database.

To create a database from shell type:

`$ createdb databaseName1`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/16.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To create a database from `psql`type:

`CREATE DATABASE databaseName2;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/17.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To see the list of databases and their details type from `psql`:

`\l`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/18.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To delete a database from the shell type:

`$ dropdb databaseName1`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/19.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

And to delete the database from the `psql` type this:

`DROP DATABASE databaseName2;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/20.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### How to connect a database

To connect a database type from the shell:

`psql databasename;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/21.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To switch from another database type:

`\c databasename2`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/22.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To get help for various SQL commands type:

`\h`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/23.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To quit from the database type:

`\q`

### The SQL Language

To store, retrieve, and manipulate database PostgreSQL uses the basic SQL language. Let's see some examples.

#### Creating a new table to a database

In SQL to create a table, we need to define the table name, column name, and their data types.

To create a table type copy this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,           -- low temperature
    temp_hi         int,           -- high temperature
    prcp            real,          -- precipitation
    date            date
);
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/24.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Here we can see a table named weather where 5 columns and their data types added. Here in the first column `city` is a column and `varchar` is its types with a range of 80 characters. We can add a comment to start with`--` and we can see three comments here.

Another example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cities (
    name            varchar(80),
    location        point
);
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/25.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

The `point` type is an example of a PostgreSQL specific data type.

#### Deleting a table from a database

To delete a database type this:

```sql
DROP TABLE tablename;
```

#### Inserting Data Into The Table

To add or insert data into a table type this example:

```sql
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25, '1994-11-27');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/26.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Here we can see the table name should be specified with its columns value.

Another example:

```sql
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('San Francisco', '(-194.0, 53.0)');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/27.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We saw a type PostgreSQL specific data type `point` above example shows that we the of `point` type should be defined as coordinate pairs.

An alternative way to insert data to avoid remembering the column name:

```sql
INSERT INTO weather (city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date)
    VALUES ('San Francisco', 43, 57, 0.0, '1994-11-29');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/28.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

The column name can be listed in a different order.

```sql
INSERT INTO weather (date, city, temp_hi, temp_lo)
    VALUES ('1994-11-29', 'Hayward', 54, 37);
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/29.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

An additional feature and optimized way to insert a large number of data just type `COPY`command with the table name and its location where the database exists.

```sql
COPY weather FROM '/location/fileName.txt';
```

#### Querying data from the table

To retrieve data from a table type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM weather;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/30.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We can write expressions, not just simple column references, in the select list. For example, we can do:

```sql
SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/31.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Deleting Data Into The Table

To delete a certain record we will use `DELETE` and `WHERE`. By using `WHERE` clause we are giving a certain condition which record to delete. We will discuss about `WHERE` more in upcoming topics.

Type this to delete the third row from the table `weather`:

`DELETE FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = 37;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/84(Deleting Data).png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now let's check the table by typing this:

`SELECT * FROM weather;`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/85(Deleting Record).png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Creating a Table With Constraints

We can specify some constraints to a table where the constraints need to be satisfied to insert data into the table.

Let's create a table with some constraints where all column has a constraint `NOT NULL` except `email`column. Type this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person1 (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(50),
	gender VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
	data_of_birth DATE NOT NULL
);
```

The constraint `NOT NULL` specifies that the column must have a data, it can not be left as blank.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/32.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Let's check and see the description of the table by typing:

`\d person`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/33.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Creating a table and Inserting Into that table from a SQL file

Let's assume that we have a SQL file where we have a table named `person` and it's column values in a location named `/filelocation/person.sql`. Now, we need to run that file from PostgreSQL prompt, then type:

`\i /filelocation/person.sql`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/34.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To retrieve all data from the table type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/35.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Sort Data by Using 'Order BY'

In SQL we can retrieve sorted data of a table by using `ORDER BY` command. Let's try to retrieve the sorted data by ascending order from our previous table by their country_of_birth. Type the following SQL Command.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth ASC;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/36.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Notice above the table where the `country_of_birth` is sorted by Ascending Order.

To sort the column by descending order type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/37.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now, notice above the table where the `country_of_birth` is sorted by Descending Order.

Like these, we can sort the table by the rest of the column names. (`id, first_name, last_name, email, date_of_birth`)

Now, Let's sort the table by multiple column names. Type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY first_name, email;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/38.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

The output of the command is showing that `first_name` and `email` columns are sorted in Ascending Order.

Taking only one column and sort that column in Ascending Order type:

```sql
SELECT last_name FROM person ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/39.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To retrieve unique data of a column we will use `DISTINCT` command.

Let's assume that we need to retrieve the unique `country_of_birth` which are appeared only once on the table `person` let's type:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name  FROM person ORDER BY first_name;
```

Following image is showing the output:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/40.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Uses of WHERE Clause, AND and OR in PostgreSQL

To retrieve data of a specific group such as `gender = Female` from the table `person` type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/41.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We can use multiple conditions in WHERE clause using `AND` conditional operator.

Let's retrieve data of male gender from country Poland, type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Male' AND country_of_birth = 'Poland';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/42.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now, we will use the OR condition to retrieve data from more than one country. For showing male gender from Poland and Bangladesh type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Male' AND country_of_birth = 'Poland' OR country_of_birth = 'Bangladesh';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/43.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using Comparison Operators in PostgreSQL

In SQL this is allowed to use some types of operations and they are:

- Arithmetic Operations
- Comparison Operations
- Bitwise Operations
- Logical Operations

Following are some comparison operations performing on `psql` :

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/44.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Here, t = true and, f = false.

We can also perform these operations on other data types. Let's see how to perform on string:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/45.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using LIMIT, OFFSET & FETCH keywords

`LIMIT` is used to retrieve specific numbers of data from data. Let's assume that we want to see only the first 10 rows from the `person` table, then type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/46.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

`OFFSET` keyword is used when we need to skip a certain amount of data and start from where want to see.

Let's assume that, we want to retrieve and show 10 rows of data skipping the first 5 rows from the table, then type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 10;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/47.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Here above image, you can see the `id` column started from `6` and showing only 10 rows till `id` is `15`.

`FETCH` keyword allows the same thing as `LIMIT` but `LIMIT` is not a standard SQL keyword where `FETCH` is an actual standard keyword in SQL.

Let's see an example, type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/48.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using of `IN` Keyword

This keyword is used for showing specific data related to specific values.

Let's assume that we want to show data only from `country_of_birth` Poland, Brazil, France, then type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ('Poland', 'Brazil', 'France');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/49.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using of `BETWEEN` Keyword

This keyword is used to select data from a range. To find persons in a specific range of `date_of_birth` type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN DATE '2019-01-01' AND '2019-10-01';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/50.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using of `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators

Let's retrieve data using `LIKE` of email addresses of `.org` the domain from `email`, type this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%.org';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/51.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We can specify at least how many characters will appear before `.org`

For example, we want only those email addresses which have at least 17 characters long before`.org` then we need to add 17 numbers of '\_' (dash) before the `.org` domain by typing like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%_________________.org';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/52.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

`ILIKE` is used to ignore the case sensitive issues. Such as, we will type same SQL command replacing `LIKE` with `ILIKE` exactly before we used where we will type `.org` as a capital case `.ORG` and it will show the exact same output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email ILIKE '%_________________.ORG';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/53.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using `GROUP BY` Keyword

This is used for grouping by the basis of columns of a table. Let's see an example.

Suppose, we need to calculate the statistics of how many people we have from each of the countries on the table. Then type this:

```sql
SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/54.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We can use `HAVING` keyword with `GRPOP BY` keyword to specify a condition.

Let's suppose that we want only those `country_of_birth` which have more than 5 persons on the table. Then type:

```sql
SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 ORDER BY country_of_birth;
```

 <img src="./complete-beginner/img/55.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We used `COUNT()` in previous examples which were an Aggregate Function. This function is used for calculating the number of values of a column. There are more aggregate functions like SUM() - calculate the summation of the values of a column, AVG() - gives an average of the values of a column, MIN() - gives the minimum value of a column, MAX() - gives the maximum value of a column, etc.

Before using these Aggregate Functions we will create a table and insert into that table from another SQL file named car.sql:

`\i /filelocation/car.sql`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/56.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To get the maximum, minimum, average and sum value of `price` type:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/57.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using Arithmetic Operations

To perform arithmetic operations have a look following the image:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/58.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To perform 10% OFF into the price of the car, let's type a query:

```sql
SELECT id, make, model, price AS Original_Price, round(price * .10, 2) AS Ten_Percent, ROUND(price - (price) * .10) AS After_Discount FROM car;
```

Here, `ROUND()` is a function to make the required figure of a number. Then `AS` is an Alias that uses to set the column names.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/59.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### How to Handle NULL Values in PostgreSQL

#### Uses of `COALESCE`

When a column has some NULL values and we want to set those values by a default value without leaving them totally blank, we can use `COALESCE` in PostgreSQL.

Let's see how it actually looks before and after using `COALESCE` when selecting data from a table.

Before using `COALESCE`:

```mssql
SELECT COALESCE(email) FROM person;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/60.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

After using `COALESCE`

```sqlite
SELECT COALESCE(email, 'Email Not Provided.') FROM person;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/61.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Uses of `NULLIF`

This is used to handle division by zero.

Have a look on the following screen shot:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/62.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We know that in arithmetic a numeric value can not be divided by Zero. So as usual Postgres

raises error while we try to perform division operation by Zero. So in that case we use the `NULLIF` keyword where two parameters are used, the first one is considered to divide the given value only if the value is greater than or equal to the second value.

It doesn't show the result while both parameters are zero, meanwhile, we can use `COALESCE` to set a default value that will show a 'Zero'

### Timestamps and Dates in PostgreSQL

Let's see some date and times operations on terminal:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/63.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Adding and Subtracting With Date

We can add or subtract with dates in PostgreSQL using the `INTERVAL` keyword.

Let's try to subtract '1 YEAR', '10 YEAR', '10 MONTHS', '10 DAYS' from current dates. Type:

```sql
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '1 YEAR';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 YEAR';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 MONTHS';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 DAY';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/64.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To add '1 YEAR', '10 YEAR', '10 MONTHS', '10 DAYS' from current dates. Type:

```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '1 YEAR';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 YEAR';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 MONTHS';
```

```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 DAY';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/65.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

If we want to cast the only date and ignore the time, type:

```sql
SELECT (NOW() + INTERVAL '10 YEAR')::DATE;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/66.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Extracting Field From Date, Times in PostgreSQL

We can extract single value such as Year, Month, Date, Minutes, etc. from dates and times by using `EXTRACT` keyword.

Let's walk through some example on terminal:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/67.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Using `AGE()` Function To Calculate Age

Let's calculate the age of all persons using `AGE()` function and `date_of_birth` column from our previous `person` table:

Type this:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, gender,country_of_birth, AGE(NOW(), date_of_birth) AS age FROM person;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/68.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### Primary Key In PostgreSQL

We use the PRIMARY KEY to differ from the same values of a column or record. Such as, we can use a unique id to identify them as individuals where two person's first_name, last_name, and date_of_birth are the same in a table.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/69.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Understanding Primary Keys

If we notice in the description of the table `person` then we can see that the table has already a constraint name 'person_pkey' for column `id` which is the PRIMARY KEY of the table. Type:

`\d person`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/70.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now type the following query to see the first row of the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 1;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/71.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now if we insert again the same record as row number 1 to the table Postgres will raise an error that will say.

`ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "person_pkey" DETAIL: Key (id)=(1) already exists.`

Let's try to insert same records into the table:

```sql
insert into person (id, first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) values (1, 'Dennis', 'Fritche', null, 'Male', '01-May-2020', 'Indonesia');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/72.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now, let's Drop the CONSTRAINT from the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE person DROP CONSTRAINT person_pkey;
ALTER TABLE
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/73.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Notice at the below image where we can see the CONSTRAINT 'person_pkey' is dropped and there is no field that contains PRIMARY KEY.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/74.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now let's try to insert same records again, and this time the record will be inserted into the table:

```sql
insert into person (id, first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) values (1, 'Dennis', 'Fritche', null, 'Male', '01-May-2020', 'Indonesia');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/75.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Type the following command to see the inserted record into the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/76.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### Adding Primary Key

In the previous topic, we dropped the CONSTRAINT from the `person` table and there is no PRIMARY KEY on the table `person`.

Now let's add PRIMARY KEY to that table by typing:

```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);
```

And This will raise an error like this:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/77.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Because the field needs to be unique to set it PRIMARY KEY but there is already two exactly the same records which we inserted into the table.

So first let's remove the duplicate records by typing this:

```sql
DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 1;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/78.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now, Insert the deleted unique record into the table:

```sql
insert into person (id, first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) values (1, 'Dennis', 'Fritche', null, 'Male', '01-May-2020', 'Indonesia');
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/79.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

This time we can add the PRIMARY KEY into the table. Type this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/80.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Let's check the CONSTRAINT of the table `person` by typing:

`\d person`

and we will notice the PRIMARY KEY is added.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/81.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

#### UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS

To set other fields or columns allowed for the only unique value that means there can not be any duplicate value in a column, we can use `UNIQUE` CONSTRAINT.

Let's make `email` column as `UNIQUE` constraint, type this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email_address UNIQUE (email);
```

To check if the CONSTRAINT is added let's type:

`\d person`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/82.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now we can not insert the same `email` value into table `person` that email address already contains any row from the table.

#### CHECK CONSTRAINTS

Another CONSTRAINT is used that checks values from a certain condition. If want to we add this constraint to the `gender` column of the table `person` then type:

```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT gender_constraint CHECK (gender = 'Female' OR gender = 'Male');
```

Here we set a CONSTRAINT that checks the inserted `gender` is whether `Male` or `Female`. That means we can not insert a record that contains any other string rather than 'Male' or 'Female',

Type `\d person` to check the CONSTRAINTS from the indexes:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/83.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### Updating Records in PostgreSQL

`UPDATE` command SQL allows us to update a column or multiple columns using `WHERE` clause.

Let's update a row where id is 901 and we will replace the email address with a new mail address:

First let's see the id number 901 with `SELECT` command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 901;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/86.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Then type the following command to update the mail address replacing by `newmail@gmail.com`.

```sql
UPDATE person SET email = 'newmail@gmail.com' WHERE id = 901;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/87.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To show the Output:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 901;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/88.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To update multiple column such as, we will update the first_name and last_name of id number 901. Let's Do it:

```sql
UPDATE person SET first_name = 'Scarlett', last_name = 'Johansson' WHERE id = 901;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/89.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 901;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/90.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### On Conflict Do Nothing

To handle duplicate key error we can use ON CONFLICT command. Let's work through on terminal:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/91.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

To ignore this error add at the end of the insert command before the semicolon end:

```sql
ON CONFLICT(id) DO NOTHING;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/92.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

**_Note:_** It will only work for the Unique column, here id and email are containing unique values.

#### ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE

This keyword does similarly what our previous `UPDATE` command was used for. Let's try to update the country_of_birth column of `id` number 1 of the `person` table.

```sql
`SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1;`
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/93.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We are going to change the country_of_birth from 'Indonesia' to 'Finland':

```sql
insert into person (id, first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) values (1, 'Dennis', 'Fritche', null, 'Male', '01-May-2020', 'Indonesia')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET country_of_birth = 'Finland';
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/94.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/95.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### What Is A Relationship/Foreign Keys

A foreign key refers to a column or a group of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table.

Let's see an example of creating two table names `customers` and `contacts`. In this example, the `customers` table is the parent table and the `contacts` table is the child table. [ i ]

Each customer has zero or many contacts and each contact belongs to zero or one customer.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers(
   customer_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE contacts(
   contact_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_id INT,
   contact_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   phone VARCHAR(15),
   email VARCHAR(100),
   PRIMARY KEY(contact_id),
   CONSTRAINT fk_customer
      FOREIGN KEY(customer_id)
	  REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

The following foreign key constraint `fk_customer` in the `contacts` table defines the `customer_id` as the foreign key:

```sql
     CONSTRAINT fk_customer
   FOREIGN KEY(customer_id)
      REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
```

The following inserts data into the `customers` and `contacts` tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers(customer_name)
VALUES('BlueBird Inc'),
      ('Dolphin LLC');

INSERT INTO contacts(customer_id, contact_name, phone, email)
VALUES(1,'John Doe','(408)-111-1234','john.doe@bluebird.dev'),
      (1,'Jane Doe','(408)-111-1235','jane.doe@bluebird.dev'),
      (2,'David Wright','(408)-222-1234','david.wright@dolphin.dev');
```

The following statement deletes the customer id 1 from the `customers` table:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

Because of the `ON DELETE NO ACTION`, PostgreSQL issues a constraint violation because the referencing rows of the customer id 1 still exist in the `contacts` table:

```
     ERROR:  update or delete on table "customers" violates foreign key constraint "fk_customer" on table "contacts"
DETAIL:  Key (customer_id)=(1) is still referenced from table "contacts".
SQL state: 23503
```

Let's walk through on terminal:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/96.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

And let's check on our `contacts` table:

`\d contacts`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/97.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

We can see that foreign-key constraints "fk_customer" were assigned successfully.

And now let's check the table data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts;

SELECT * FROM customers;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/98.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/99.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### Inner Join

`INNER JOIN` takes whats the common between two tables.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/Inner_Join.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

**Inner Join in PostgreSQL:**

To see INNER JOIN between two tables `contacts` and `customers type:`

```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts
JOIN customers ON contacts.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/100.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Note: A `JOIN` simply links two tables where the primary key and foreign key is found in both tables.

### Left Join

A Left Join between two tables `A` and `B` includes all rows of table `A` and as always the records from table `B` that has a corresponding relationship with table `A`.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/LeftJoin.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

In case the Left Join includes those rows also where the foreign key wasn't assigned.

To show left join between `contacts` and `customer` table type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts LEFT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = contacts.customer_id;
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/101.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### Deleting Records with foreign keys

When we try to delete a record from `customers` table it will raise an error. Let's say we want to delete a record from `customers` table where customer_id = 2 and the error will raise something following like this:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/102.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

In that case, it means that first, we have to delete the record from the `contacts` table where the foreign key was assigned.

Let's delete the record from `contacts` table:

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/103.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

This is showing the record is deleted successfully.

And then now we can delete the record from the `customers` table too!

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/104.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### Exporting Query Results To CSV

We can see the directory where our files are saving by typing:

`\!pwd`

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/105.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

Now let's export the csv file `result.csv` from a table to that location:

`\copy ( SELECT * FROM contacts LEFT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = contacts.customer_id) TO '/var/lib/postgresql/results.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER; `

Here is the location where result.csv is exported.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/106.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

And here is the exported CSV file.

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/107.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />

### UUID Data Type

This generates a universally unique identifier, which is a 128-bit number used to identify unique information. We can use UUID to set our primary key where we need unique sets of values.

To install or create UUID to our Postgres database we simply type:

`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"; `

This is an extension or a function and to check all the other extensions just type:

`select * from pg_available_extensions;`

To see the installed functions:

`\df`

There will be several versions of UUID available. If we type the command `uuid_generate_v4` every time this will generate a unique key always.

To genrate the UUID key type:

```sql
SELECT uuid_generate_v4();
```

<img src="./complete-beginner/img/108.png" alt="PostgreSQL Icon" style="zoom:110%;" />
